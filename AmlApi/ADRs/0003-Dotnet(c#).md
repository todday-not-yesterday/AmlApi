# Backend decision 

## Context and Problem Statement    

Our AML solution requires a robust and scalable backend framework. It must be modern, widely used, easily integrable, and supported over the long. 

## Considered Options  

* .NET - C# 

*  Spring - Java 

*  Django - Python 

## Decision Outcome  

* .NET - We chose .NET as it meets all of our requirements 

## Consequences    

* Choosing .NET as the backend framework will set a strong foundation for our AML solution, ensuring we benefit from great performance and lots of developer tools. As we build our technology stack, this decision aligns us with a well-supported platform by Microsoft, facilitating future scaling, maintenance and growth. 

## Pros 

* Performance: .NET is known for its excellent performance which is one of our core Non-functional requirements. 

* Integration: Offers robust support for integrating with various databases and external systems. 

* Community Support: Benefits from a strong, active community and comprehensive documentation. 

* Longevity: Established track record and ongoing support from Microsoft ensure reliability. 

## Cons 

* Costs: Potential higher costs due to reliance on other Microsoft products and services. 

* Learning Curve: May present a learning challenge for teams not already familiar with .NET. 

* Deployment: Primarily optimized for Windows, though cross-platform support is improving.
