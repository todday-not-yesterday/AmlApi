# Visualise entities needed and their relationships for AML  

## Context and Problem Statement  

Having this diagram would create more discussions about the solution in the team as well as having a structure/clear plan to implement from highlighting all different relationships. 

## Considered Options  

* ER Diagram  

## Decision Outcome  

* ER Diagram, because it would be clear to follow and would work well with our decision since we are using PostgreSQL as mentioned in 0001-PostgreSQL.  

## Consequences  

* A diagram that resolves all of the entities and their relationships would be followed  

## Pros 

* It is easy to set up and make. 

* Can save a lot of time down the line. 

* Normalization can be done early on to sanitize the data, ensuring we don't end up with messy data that is either redundant or hard to follow. 

## Cons 

* It can cause problems during implementation, as a team we need to pay attention with what we are implementing during development, and not rely solely on this diagram.
