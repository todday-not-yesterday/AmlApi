# Visualise entities needed and their relationships for AML  

## Context and Problem Statement  

The advanced media library requires a complex data structure, that provides the ability to meet the requirements given.

## Considered Options  

* ER Diagram  

## Decision Outcome  

* ER Diagram

## Consequences  

* A diagram that create clear building blocks for developers, that ensures requirements are met.  

## Pros 

* Free tools such as: draw io and lucidchart

* It is easy to set up and make 

* Helps to ensure budget and time frames are met

* Normalisation can be done early on to sanitise the data, ensuring we don't end up with messy data that is either redundant or hard to follow 

* Works well with our decision since we are using PostgreSQL as mentioned in 0001-PostgreSQL

## Cons 

* The diagram would need to be fully done before the start of development

* Changes to diagram can be extremely costly

* It can cause problems during implementation, as a team we need to pay attention with what we are implementing during development, and not rely solely on this diagram
